# Amazon Connect ContactCenterOps

[Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/) is a cloud-based contact center that can easily scale according to your requirements. It is the only contact center technology that was built from the ground up directly on AWS services and infrastructure, which makes it incredibly robust and flexible. With a unique consumption pricing model, you can innovate at your own pace, since you don’t have upfront commitments with pay as you go pricing. Amazon Connect also delivers dynamic, personal, and natural contact flows that also allows you to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to respond to customer’s needs. It is an open platform where you can integrate to the AWS ecosystem easily to provide advanced analytics capabilities, for you to manage and analyze your contact center data the way you choose, and much more.

In this repository, we show how we can use Infrastructure as Code (Iac) to define our contact centers in code, allowing us to deploy our contact centers in the cloud in a consistent manner. We also provide IaC template for sample DevOps pipelines to show we can manage our Amazon Connect infrastructure at scale across multiple environments.
